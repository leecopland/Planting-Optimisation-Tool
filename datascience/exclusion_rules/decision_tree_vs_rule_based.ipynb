    "## Comparison of Rule-Based and Decision Tree Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches can be used to implement exclusion logic, but they differ in structure and behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintainability\n",
    "In a rule-based approach, each rule is implemented as a separate check.\n",
    "This makes the code easier to read and maintain, especially when the number of rules grows.\n",
    "In contrast, a decision tree requires changes to the tree structure when new rules are added,\n",
    "which can make maintenance more difficult over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ease of Updates\n",
    "Rule-based logic allows new rules to be added or removed with minimal impact on existing rules.\n",
    "Each rule can be updated independently.\n",
    "With a decision tree, updates often require restructuring the tree or reordering conditions,\n",
    "which increases the risk of introducing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transparency and Debugging\n",
    "Rule-based models are generally easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "It is clear which rule caused a species to be excluded, and multiple failure reasons can be recorded.\n",
    "Decision trees follow a fixed path, so only the first failing condition is usually captured,\n",
    "which makes detailed explanations harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Data\n",
    "Rule-based logic can easily skip rules when required data is missing,\n",
    "without excluding the species.\n",
    "In a decision tree, missing data often needs special handling at each node,\n",
    "which adds complexity to the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Rule Growth and Dependencies\n",
    "As more rules and species dependencies are introduced,\n",
    "a rule-based approach scales more naturally.\n",
    "Decision trees can become large and rigid as more conditions are added,\n",
    "making them harder to modify when requirements change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Fit for This Project\n",
    "Because exclusion rules are expected to change over time and may depend on incomplete data,\n",
    "the rule-based approach provides better flexibility and long-term maintainability for this project.\n"

    "- Failure reasons are easy to track and explain\n",
